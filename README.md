# Sharkonfig
This is simply a collection of user configs, which are meant to be used in [uBlahaj](https://github.com/Sharkitty/uBlahaj). uBlahaj being based on fedora atomic, these configs are made with fedora in mind.

This repository also includes a python script to copy these configs into your home directory. Careful however: In the current implementation, if any file exists at the destination path, it will be overwritten (Will fix that later).

## How to use it
Configuration files are in the `configs` directory, you can copy any config file that interests you from there, into your home directory.

Alternatively you can use the provided script: `python3 scripts/copy.sh`.
